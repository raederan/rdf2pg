# RDF2PG

A java application to transform RDF databases into Property Graph (PG) databases.
rdf2pg implements three transformation methods described in the journal article
"Mapping RDF Databases to Property Graph Databases"
(IEEE Access, May 2020), which is available at [IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9088985).

## Project Description

This project transforms RDF datasets into a CSV files for futher parsing, mass uploading RDF-like property graph data into RAPSQL Databases, which build on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Apache AGE](https://age.apache.org/). RAPSQL Databases are in development for possible backend solutions of [OpenSemanticLab](https://github.com/OpenSemanticLab), which builds on [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/), [Semantic Media Wiki](https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Semantic_MediaWiki) focuses on Ontology-Interoperability.

## Maven Migration

1. Create new Java project using maven-archetype-quickstart
2. Configure `pom.xml` and add dependencies
3. Move `src` to `src/main/java/rapsql/rdf2pg`
4. Move `test` to `src/test/java/rapsql/rdf2pg`
5. Add and change `import` and `package` statements for each java file
